# Cooking-channels
There are two cooking channels Nisha Madhulika cooking channels and Kabita's Kitchen in Hinglish (mixture of English and Hindi) language.
Firstly, DBSCAN algorithm is applied on both the datasets to make the clusters and label the data. Then, supervised classification 
algorithms are employed using different vectorization techniques.
1.	cleanandcluster.py – In this file coding about unsupervised learning techniques like DBSCAN, k means clustering are done.
2.	Nisha_tfidf.py – In this file, tf-idf vectorizer is done on the Nisha Madhulika’s dataset.
3.  Nisha_termfrequency.py - In this file, term frequency vectorizer is done on the NIsha Madhulika's dataset.
4.	Nishacount.py – In this file, count vectorizer is done on the Nisha Madhulika’s dataset.
5.	Kabita_tfidf.py – In this file, tf-idf vectorizer is done on the Kabita’s dataset.
6.	Kab_count.py – In this file, count vectorizer is done on the Kabita’s dataset.
7.  kab_termfrequency.py- In this file, term frequency vectorizer is done on the Kabita's dataset.
